In which I have no evidence of payment. & you have no receipts or details of that payment(Breach of Travel triangle policy....)2. Drive intentionally brought us to the places where he can get good comission. He denied to take us to Solang valley by CAR but asked us to pay for Hampta Pass.(Drivers are not trustworthy, but we trusted Travel Traingle. Again you Failed).3. Your agent Discover My Travel promised us to get a good car. But he send us old inefficient car.(Its tires were totally worn out. & he changed two tyres during traivelling because of Tyre failures. In such areas you should have good tyre otherwise your life can be at Risk. We are sorry to choose you).4. At Dharamshala, Driver dropped us as Dharamshala in the evening at hotel & went to his own home for 1.5 days. & he asked us to walk & travel on our own.(Which kind of Proffessionalism is this ? Will you expect this with your travel agent ?)5. At Dalhousie as Khajjiar was closed. He told us to roam around on our own. As he wanted to rest at hotel.Good Points: 1. Hotels were good(We chose it after much internet surfing & reading reviews. Though thank you for booking).2. Your partner (discover my travel) is good. But driver he found was not good. Conclusion : 1. We can not trust your words. You change them anytime.2. Your partner does not have enough skill to provide good hospitality to travellers as driver/car is the most important part when you have to travel a lot.3. Payment terms must not be changed in any case. (half cash / half online is not good).",

Also the houseboat quality was gud but the experience wasn't great enough, also the hospitality in the houseboat wasn't great enough. Overall  improvement is needed.Special thanks to Sunaina for always being patient and attending to my queries and expectations promptly.Also another thiing which I didnt like at all was the net banking or debit/card fees being charged while making online payments, it was quite a considerable amount, would ask you guys/Travel triangle to try atleast reduce the same if not possible to remove entirely.",
